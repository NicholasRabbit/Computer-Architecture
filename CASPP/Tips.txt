If you have trouble with Chapter 7 Linking, I recommend reading the book Programmer's Self-Cultivation, subtitled link. load and library. This book can complete our understanding of program linking, and I believe after reading this book you will have a deeper comprehension of program linking, ELF files, and dynamic libraries. It is highly recommended to be read as a supplementary material after reading CSAPP and having a certain understanding of computer systems.
